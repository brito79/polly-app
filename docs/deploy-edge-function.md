## Verify Deployment

## Common Issues

### Authentication Errors

If you see errors like:
```
Access token has expired or is invalid
```

You need to refresh your Supabase CLI login:

supabase login
```

### Missing Secrets

If the function fails with missing environment variables:
1. Check that you've set all required secrets
2. Verify that the secrets are correctly spelled

### Function Not Found

If the function is deployed but still returns a "Function not found" error:
1. Make sure you've linked to the correct Supabase project
2. Try re-deploying the function
3. Check if there are any permissions issues in your Supabase settings

## Next Steps

After deploying:
1. Monitor the function logs in the Supabase Dashboard
2. Set up a cron schedule for automatic running
3. Test with an expiring poll to verify the entire workflow
