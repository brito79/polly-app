# Email Notification Testing Guide

## Recent Updates

We've made the following improvements to the email notification system:

1. **Fixed Module Type Issue**:
   - Added `"type": "module"` to `package.json` to properly recognize ES modules

2. **Resolved Domain Verification Error**:
   - Updated sender email to use Resend's verified address: `onboarding@resend.dev`
   - Created documentation about domain verification in `docs/resend-domain-verification.md`

3. **Enhanced Edge Function Testing**:
   - Added `from_email` parameter to Edge Function test request

## How to Test

You can now test the email notification system using:

```bash
npm run test:email    # Test direct email sending
npm run test:edge     # Test the Edge Function
```

## Expected Results

- The test email should now be delivered to your inbox without domain verification errors
- The email will appear from `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend's verified address)
- Check the Resend dashboard to confirm email delivery status

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Emails in Resend Dashboard**:
   - Log in to your Resend account
   - Check the "Emails" tab for delivery status

2. **Set Up Domain Verification**:
   - Follow the guide in `docs/resend-domain-verification.md` for production use
   - Once verified, update your `.env.local` file with your domain

3. **Test Edge Function Integration**:
   - Create test polls with expiration times
   - Verify the complete notification flow

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
- Check `.env.local` for correct API keys
- Ensure Resend account is active and has available credits
- Review Edge Function logs in Supabase dashboard
